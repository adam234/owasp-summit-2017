The OWASP Summit team is committed to bringing as many OWASP Leaders (and other contributors) to the Summit. 

&nbsp;

Most summit attendes are able to be sponsored by the company they work for to cover the Summit expenses (ticket, travel and time). 

&nbsp;

For the cases where that is not possible (maybe because the company is not able to cover the expenses, the participant is an independently contractor or works for a start-up), there are a number of ways where the OWASP Foundation and the Summit team will be able to cover the ticket and travel costs.

&nbsp;

If you are interested in going to the Summit and need support, add your name to the [Participants need support](Participants-need-support.html) list and chose one of the options below:

&nbsp;

1. **Ask an OWASP Chapter or Project** (with funds) to sponsor you (here is the list of the [funds avaialble to chapters and projects](https://docs.google.com/a/owasp.org/spreadsheets/d/11acTOmtmBGq6-5CIGsjlEByU8POSGqda0r23VNnhEGQ/pub?hl=en_US&hl=en_US&output=html))
2. **Apply to OWASP Foundation** for a sponsorship to participate in this event ([using this form](https://www.tfaforms.com/308703))
3. **Become an [Summit Editor](Summit-Editor.html)** - An Summit Editor is somebody that is going to work hard **before the Summit**, helping with summit related tasks/activities, in exchange for an Summit Ticket and travel expenses
4. **Become an [Workshop Admin](Workshop-Admin.html)** - An Workshop Admin is somebody that is going to work hard **during the Summit**, helping with workshop related tasks/activities, in exchange for an Summit Ticket and travel expenses. 



### Funding rounds
