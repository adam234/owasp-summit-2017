The joint purpose of the OWASP Chapter Handbook and the OWASP Chapter Leader Handbook is to provide chapter leaders with a central repository of information about starting a chapter, organising a chapter meeting, handling chapter finances, etc.   
The Handbook is currently under review, and the updated version is currently in draft form.
