## Why

> [OWASP Juice Shop Project](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Juice_Shop_Project "OWASP Juice Shop Project")
> is an intentionally insecure webapp for security training written
> entirely in JavaScript and which encompasses the entire OWASP Top Ten
> and other severe security flaws. Juice Shop is written in Node.js,
> Express, and AngularJS. The application contains more than 30
> challenges of varying difficulty where the user should exploit the
> underlying vulnerabilities. Apart from being useful for hacker and
> awareness training, pentesting proxies or security scanners can also
> use Juice Shop as a "guinea pig" application to check how well their
> tools cope with JavaScript-heavy application frontends and REST APIs.


## What

Ideas for potential new hacking challenges are currently collected in
the
[OWASP Summit Challenge Pack 2017](https://github.com/bkimminich/juice-shop/milestone/3)
milestone on GitHub. In this working session we will brainstorm & design
many of the existing - and hopefully several entirely new - challenges
that we will be implemented by on-site and remote particpants in the
[Juice Shop Coding Day](https://owaspsummit.org/Working-Sessions/Juice-Shop/Juice-Shop-Coding-Day.html)
and
[Juice Shop Coding Night](https://owaspsummit.org/Working-Sessions/Juice-Shop/Juice-Shop-Coding-Night.html)
sessions. Production release is planned for the final day of the summit
in the
[Juice Shop Release](https://owaspsummit.org/Working-Sessions/Juice-Shop/Juice-Shop-Release.html)
session.

We will also consider planned functional enhancements of the
[Juice Shop CTF-extension](https://www.npmjs.com/package/juice-shop-ctf-cli)
and its improved integration with [CTFd](https://ctfd.io/). Ideas for
the CTF-extension are currently gathered as
[_enhancement_-issues on GitHub](https://github.com/bkimminich/juice-shop-ctf/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Aenhancement).

## Outcomes

This working session will gather, discuss and design the following:

- GitHub issues for several new challenges in OWASP Juice Shop
- GitHub issues for new functional enhancements to place challenges in,
  e.g. user stories like the
  [Order Dashboard](https://github.com/bkimminich/juice-shop/issues/244)
  and
  [~~Pomace Recycling~~](https://github.com/bkimminich/juice-shop/issues/243)(_done!_)
- GitHub issues for functional and convenience improvements to the Juice
  Shop CTF-extension
- [Updated project roadmap](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Juice_Shop_Project#tab=Road_Map_and_Getting_Involved)
  for OWASP Juice Shop and its CTF-extension
