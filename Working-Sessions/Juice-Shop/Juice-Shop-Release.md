## Why

> [OWASP Juice Shop Project](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Juice_Shop_Project "OWASP Juice Shop Project")
> is an intentionally insecure webapp for security training written
> entirely in JavaScript and which encompasses the entire OWASP Top Ten
> and other severe security flaws. Juice Shop is written in Node.js,
> Express, and AngularJS. The application contains more than 30
> challenges of varying difficulty where the user should exploit the
> underlying vulnerabilities. Apart from being useful for hacker and
> awareness training, pentesting proxies or security scanners can also
> use Juice Shop as a "guinea pig" application to check how well their
> tools cope with JavaScript-heavy application frontends and REST APIs.

## Who

The target audience for this Working Session is:

- everyone who was involved any Juice Shop-related session throughout
  the summit
- everyone who'd like to see the power of CI/CD automation with GitHub,
  Travis-CI and friends

---

## Working materials

Release commands for OWASP Juice Shop:

```bash
git checkout master
git merge develop
git tag v4.0.0 -s -m "v4.0.0"
git push --follow-tags
```

The rest will be done _automagically_ by the build and deployment script for Travis-CI and a small army of GitHub webhooks.

> For the CTF-Extension the commands are identical except for the version being `v1.2.0`.
