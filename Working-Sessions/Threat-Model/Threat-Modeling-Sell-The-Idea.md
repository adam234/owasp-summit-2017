## When and where

The page documents the outcome of a 2 hour working session held in London in February 2018. Details available here: https://pbx-group-security.com/working-sessions/

## Selling Threat Modeling

We put together ideas for a brief 3 slide presentation aimed at a selling the idea of threat modelling to a product owner.

### Example presentation

A draft presentation has been created to illustrate what the below content might look like in a deck. It is basic and was created using the features of Google Slides, so a proper version would need much more work. Ideally with the help of a graphic designer.

The presentation is available as [PowerPoint](OWASP_Hidden_cost_of_insecurity.pptx) and [PDF](OWASP_Hidden_cost_of_insecurity.pdf).

### General/rough notes for the session

Getting developer buy-in

"haven't got time"

* get to break stuff
* take a feature and put everything out of scope
* start small - a few key people, one team to test it
* non-judgemental
* use what you're comfortable
* business owns the outcome (e.g. documenting threats)
* security facilitates
* security champions
* sell to the product owner
* advocates at the bottom, buy-in from the top
* threat modelling running sytems vs SDLC
* what's the benefit - engineer, product owner, risk
* what to do when issus identified? Blame? Panic?.... - culture
* legacy system - we don't care :(
* priority. tm can help prioritize the risk?
* can TM "enable" agile/devops?
* Get buy from the top? (optional)
* Identify a small, friendly dev team

### Who is the target audience?

Product Owner

Persona attributes:
* Non-technical
* Busy
* Cares and takes pride in their work and deliverables
* May have regulation concerns
* Fear of the unknown
* Doesn't want additional work
* Full-stack-responsibility - They care from design to operations

### Slide 1 - The problem statement

* Don't know / can't measure / uninformed about the risks associated with the
platform
* Unknown costs of remediation, regulatory fines, brand damage
* Return on Investment is incomplete
* Cost of fixing issues gets higher as you get closer to production
* A pentest finding an issue in pre-production could push back releases by
weeks
* You might not be putting security where it's needed - wasted effort,
false sense of security

### Slide 1 - Alternative

* Would you like to know that your ROI calculations are well constructed?
* Would you like to make informed risk decisions?
* Would you like to deliver agreed scope more quickly?

### Slide 2 - How does threat modeling solve this?

* Comparison to Penetration Testing (how do they compliment, where in
lifecycle)
* Identify and quantify threats
* Make informed decisions through discussion
* Prioritisation
* Risk equation
* Get documentation for free
* Threat modeling isn't the only solution, not the complete picture

### Slide 3 - Next steps

* Training for develops, security to facilitate and mentor
* start small - a friendly willing team, a few key people, one team to test it
* take a feature and put everything out of scope
* blameless culture
* use what you're comfortable
* business owns the outcome (e.g. documenting threats)
