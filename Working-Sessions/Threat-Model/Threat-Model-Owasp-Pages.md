## Why

...why text...

## What

What constitutes "complete?"  Is complete the right goal?  Would we aim for a complete how to for creating a web page?  If threat modeling is roughly as complex a set of skills and processes as programming, then do we want a how-to for CSS and another for database back-ends?
