Purpose of the GA discussion is to discuss goals of workshops and overarching mission behind the Threat Modeling working sessions for the week.  First day will be a longer session and daily session will simply be an hour before break out sessions begin.

Duration: 2 hours

Discussion: Adam Shostack (currently listed as the only participant) will be arriving Monday mid-day; I suggest that we hold the first either late Monday or early Tuesday.
