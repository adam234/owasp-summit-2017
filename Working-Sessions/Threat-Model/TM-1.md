Get together to create models of the Juiceshop app, learn threat modeling, and deliver examples.

## Why

Dinis proposed a set of evening sessions to create threat model artifacts & examples for the JuiceShop vulnerable app.

## What

Produce diagrams that show various aspects of Juiceshop: model 1: what's the app?  model 2: how does it get deployed?  Model 3? How is it "developed and maintained"?  Other models as seem possibly interesting.

## Definition of Done

Graphics checked into github.

## Who

Participants in the threat modeling track, participants interested in juiceshop, those who want to learn to threat model.
