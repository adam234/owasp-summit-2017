> [OWASP Threat Modeling Cheat Sheet](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Threat_Modeling_Cheat_Sheet)
> The objective of this cheat sheet is to provide guidance to developers, reviewers, designers and architects on conducting successful
> threat modeling. The main goal of threat modeling is to understand the controls needed for a software system. The Cheat Sheet will abide by the similar prescriptive and concise recommendations for threat modelers to consider when building an application threat model.  The Cheat Sheet series will aim to build upon a Lightweight Threat Modeling Process and simply list out do's and don'ts that address the following:

    - The trust boundaries to and within the solution that we build
    - The actors that interact within and outside the trust boundaries
    - Information flows within, and to and from, the trust boundaries
    - Information persistence within and outside the trust boundaries
    - Vulnerabilities at the trust boundaries
    - Threat agents that can exploit the vulnerabilities
    - Impact of exploitation of vulnerability by threat agents
    - Controls and processes needed to treat specific risks

## Why

Threat modelling still needs adoption into current SDLC methodologies. Many development groups strive to apply threat modelling efforts under tight development windows.  The threat modelling cheat sheet aims to provide prescriptive guidance on scoping, application component enumeration, threat modeling activities, and key deliverables.  This workshop will also provide prescriptive tools and techniques to use to conduct various types of threat models that are both agnostic to various threats and platforms, and specific to certain types of threats.
The cheat sheet will provide a guide to the heavyweight approach to threat modelling.
Because some teams may find the heavyweight approach too cumbersome and onerous, we will also define a lightweight approach that should represent the Minimum Viable Threat Modelling activity to follow.

## What

 - DFD Template
 - Kill chain templatehttps://github.com/OWASP/owasp-summit-2017/tree/master/Working-Sessions/Threat-Model
 - Attack tree template
 - Component enumeration techniques
 - Attack library build out and mapping
 - Proposed threat library and integration
 - Weakness library management and integration
 - Lightweight Threat Modeling Steps
 ** What should a lightweight process produce?
 ** What are the simplest steps we can follow to arrive at that deliverable?

## Outcomes

- Threat modelling cheat sheets published for heavy and lightweight approaches

## Who

The target audience for this Working Session is:

 - Application Architects (for DFD creation, templating)
 - Web developers of varying language backgrounds (.NET, Java, PHP, .js, etc.)
 - DBAs/ DB Developers
 - Security professionals w/ application architecture, software development experience

## Working materials

- Draft threat modelling cheat sheets published for heavy and lightweight approaches
