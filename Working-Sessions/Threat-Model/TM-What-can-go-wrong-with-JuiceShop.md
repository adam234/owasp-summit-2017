Get together to use the models of Juice Shop to find problems with it, learn threat modeling, and deliver examples.

## Why

Dinis proposed a set of evening sessions to create threat model artifacts & examples for the Juice Shop vulnerable app.

## What

Using the diagrams that show various aspects of Juice Shop (model 1: what's the app?  model 2: how does it get deployed?  Model 3? How is it "developed and maintained"?  Other models as seem possibly interesting), apply various techniques to answer the question "what can go wrong?"  Techniques might include brainstorming, STRIDE, top-10, PASTA, CAPEC, attack trees, or your favorite.

## Definition of Done

Lists of attacks checked in.  Possibly also sets of requirements or assumptions.
## Who

Participants in the threat modeling track, participants interested in Juice Shop, those who want to learn to threat model.
