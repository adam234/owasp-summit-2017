## Why

Use of vulnerable components (A9) contributes to some of the worlds largest breaches. It is unique among other types of security issues - in that vulnerabilities can suddenly arrise at any point in the software development lifecycle with or without code changes. OWASP Dependency-Check - a project created by Jeremy Long in 2012 - is a flagship OWASP project with thousands of users and many volunteers. It has grown from a single command line tool into a full suite designed to provide visibility of vulnerable components throughout the software development lifecycle. 

## What

* An overview of the state-of-the-art of the Dependency-Check & Dependency-Track ecosystem
* Provide sneak peak at v2.0.0
* Demos (may the demo gods be gracious)
* Get direct feedback on existing and in-progress features

## Outcomes

* Identify areas - Dependency-Check and Dependency-Track need improvement
* Learn about complementary issues that put use of third-party components at risk
* Learn how to contribute to the projects

## Who

* Security practitioners
* CI/CD/DevOps practitioners
* Software engineers
* QA engineers
* Anyone responsible for the design, creation, testing, or operation of software
