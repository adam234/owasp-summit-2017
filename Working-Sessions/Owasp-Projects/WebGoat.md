## Why

WebGoat is a deliberately insecure web application maintained by OWASP designed to teach web application security lessons. You can install and practice with WebGoat. There are other 'goats' such as WebGoat for .Net. In each lesson, users must demonstrate their understanding of a security issue by exploiting a real vulnerability in the WebGoat application. For example, in one lesson the user must use SQL injection to steal fake credit card numbers. The application aims to provide users with a realistic learning environment, giving them hints and code that further explains each lesson.

The focus of WebGoat 8.0 is to train developers not only how to exploit, but also how to fix and mitigate, a vulnerability. 

This Working Session will explore how WebGoat can be improved.

## What

- Add the ability to fix a vulnerability within a lesson. Instead of just finding an issue, we want to allow users to try and fix the issue. It is technically challenging to implement this without restarting the complete WebGoat application
- We need to 'automatically' verify an implemented fix. We need test cases which will try to trigger the issue. It would be nice to develop a shared knowledge base in which anyone can submit their solution and others could try to break proposed solutions 
- Develop a shared knowledge base for different Goat implementations. Only the language implementation details are 
 different; the explanation about a specific vulnerability and mitigation can be shared
- Develop more lesson content, for example lessons specifically about crypto 

## Outcomes

- New test cases
- New shared knowledge base
- New lesson content, including content on how to fix vulnerabilities

### Synopsis and Takeaways

- Add lessons not found in other Goat like applications e.g., SSRF
- Discussion about sharing content between Goat like applications such as WebGoat, NodeGoat, etc.
- Flexibility when presenting in lessons
- Language support discussion and agreed on supporting one language and focus on other features first 
- How to integrate automated vulnerability checking into WebGoat
- Fixing a lesson should be added so developers can fix as well as break
- New lesson ideas
      - Upload functionality
      - Path traversal with shell upload
      - Crypto
      - Focus on HTML5
      - JSON Injection
      - Business logic 
               - e.g., After payment of an order repeat the request and keep ordering the TVs without paying. 

##  Who

The target audience for this Working Session is:

- Web application developers
- Teachers of web application security
