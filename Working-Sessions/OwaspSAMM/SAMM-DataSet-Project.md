Follow-up of the Benchmark project

## Why

As a community, we are long overdue a standard way of collecting SAMM results to help build a dataset of where organizations are and how they are improving in relation to secure software. This session aims to tackle some of the design and logistics challenges that effect anonymous data collection and aggregation.

## What

- Goals of SAMM Dataset
- Logistics of Data Collection and Anonymisation
- Data Model Review/Refinement

## Outcomes

### Synopsis and Takeaways

- The Dataset Project was unanimously agreed upon to be a key project for OWASP and is worth pursuing.
- The Dataset project is key to the SAMM project as a whole
- For the project to progress steadily it is important to collect names that are willing to contribute to the project consistently
- Create a survey that is to be sent via the "SAMM users mailing list", in order to gain valuable information about what users want from the Dataset


## Who

The target audience for this Working Session is:

- Security champions
- Security architects
- DevOps Roles
- CISO
