Introduction to Generic DevOps Security Maturity Model

## Why

get understanding of DevOps vocabulary / see how we could reuse parts/complete GDOSMM?

## What

- Introduction of the model
- see link http://gdosmm-translation.timo-pagel.de/ (model)
- see link https://drive.google.com/open?id=1rrbyXqxy3LXAJNPFrVH99mj_BNaJKymMsXZItYArWEM (presentation)
- Discussion on usability within SAMM?

## Outcomes

### Synopsis and Takeaways
- No need to change the core model but reviewing the SAMM activities is important to assure they are implementation neutral
- In addition Implementation advice can be included for different roles and processes e.g. DevOps, Waterfall and Agile
- GDOSMM is a potential implementation subset of SAMM
- An evening session was agreed for model mapping SAMM to GDOSMM
- The effort/impact dimensions suggested make for an interesting addition to activities

The target audience for this Working Session is:

- Security champions
