Improve the core model Metrics

## Why

SAMM currently has a very basic set of metrics for measuring progress and benefit. We need to build up the metrics in the core model to provide organisations with a solid way of understanding when they are improving, and what activities provide the most benefit.

## What

- Review of existing metrics
- Propose new metrics per business function or activity
- Determine plan for continuing metrics updates

## Outcomes

This Working Session will result in updated SAMM Metrics and an outline plan for the future updates.

### Synopsis and Takeaways

- There is a need to evaluate adding an optional depth component to scoring for questionnaire
- Need to most likely remove success metrics and replace with Business Metrics
          - Alternatively Metrics may have its own section
          - We need to focus on metrics ranging from operational to strategic operations
- Three logical categories of metrics:
          - App
          - Process
          - Environment

## Who

The target audience for this Working Session is:

- Security champions
- Security architects
- DevOps Roles
- CISO
