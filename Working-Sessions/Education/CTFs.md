## Why 

In this working session we can share our experience of various CTF
formats, tools, and frameworks.

## What

- Open sources frameworks(like [CTFd](https://ctfd.io) or
  [FBCTF](https://github.com/facebook/fbctf))
- Experience gained from OWASP University Challenge sessions
- How to support different "modes" in training applications (i.e.
  lesson-mode, exercise-mode, awareness-mode, and CTF-mode)
- How to organize your own CTF session for an OWASP Chapter Meeting
  (e.g. with the help of
  [OWASP Virtual Village](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Virtual_Village_Project)
  resources)


## Outcomes

- TODO
- Suggested Outcome:  A doc. for OWASP groups which walks potential leaders through the decisions and process of hosting CTFs for fun and training.

## Who

The target audience for this Working Session is:

- CTF organisers (and those who would like to become one)
- CTF participants (and those who would like to become one)
- Authors of CTF frameworks
- Authors of vulnerable web applications
