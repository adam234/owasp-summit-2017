When creating horizontal security teams across multiple teams or squads, there are two models that have gained some traction: Security Guilds and Security Champions.

## Why

This working session will discuss common terminology and workflows as it is important that industry agrees on and recognises the distinctions between Security Guilds and Security Champions.  

## What

 - What are the best definitions of Security Guilds and Security Champions?
 - How different are they?
 - Should Security Champions be part of a Security Guild?
 - Should they be merged?

## Outcomes

Security Champions are a key element of an AppSec team, since they create a cross-functional team focused on Application Security.
