## Why

This Working Session will focus on how the security teams and developers in two or more companies can collaborate to implement hackathons on their own products or websites. A good subject for such a hackathon would be new tools, new products, or new websites that a company has been developing. 

A cross-company hackathon is a great way to create and develop a culture of collaboration. Given the fact that there will be many different companies represented at the Summit, with many CISOs, security teams, and developer teams, this session is a great opportunity to create a playbook, or a set of rules of engagement, for how a cross-company hackathon could work.
