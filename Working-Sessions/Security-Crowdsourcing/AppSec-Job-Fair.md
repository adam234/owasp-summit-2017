## Why

 Many Summit participants will be looking for new challenges and opportunities in 2017. This Working Session
 (most likely to be scheduled during the evenings) will be a forum for companies and recruiters to present
 interesting job opportunities and discuss them with the participants (privately or in a group setting).

This session will also be a great place to hold thoughtful conversations about different kinds of security careers, top skills in high demand, and the newest opportunities within the field.  

## What

 - Companies and recruiters will present job opportunities
 - Informal conversations about the current state of the job market
