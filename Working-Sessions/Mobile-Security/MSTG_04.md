## Why

As of today, no widely accepted standard for mobile app security exists. The goal of our project is to rectify this situation. In addition to a [mobile appsec security standard](https://github.com/OWASP/owasp-masvs), we are producing a comprehensive [testing guide](https://github.com/OWASP/owasp-mstg) that covers the processes, techniques, and tools used during a mobile app security test, as well as an exhaustive set of test cases that enables testers to deliver consistent and complete results. We aim to release the guide in the form of a free e-book and potentially a printed book by the end of this year.

## What

The objective of this working session is to complete a first draft of the Mobile Security Testing Guide (MSTG). Tasks include:

- Write original content, such as describing testing processes and writing test cases
- Proofread and technical edit to improve the overall quality of the MSTG

Participants may join working groups organised along the main topics covered in the guide. Work will be split between working groups based on mobile OS and topics as listed below.

This working session focuses on mobile app security testing on iOS.

Associated chapters in the MSTG:
- [iOS Security Testing Basics](https://github.com/OWASP/owasp-mstg/blob/master/Document/0x06b-Basic-Security-Testing.md)
- [Testing Data Storage](https://github.com/OWASP/owasp-mstg/blob/master/Document/0x06d-Testing-Data-Storage.md)
- [Testing Cryptography](https://github.com/OWASP/owasp-mstg/blob/master/Document/0x06e-Testing-Cryptography.md)
- [Testing Authentication and Session Management](https://github.com/OWASP/owasp-mstg/blob/master/Document/0x06f-Testing-Authentication-and-Session-Management.md)
- [Testing Network Communication](https://github.com/OWASP/owasp-mstg/blob/master/Document/0x06g-Testing-Network-Communication.md)
- [Testing Platform Interaction](https://github.com/OWASP/owasp-mstg/blob/master/Document/0x06h-Testing-Platform-Interaction.md)
- [Testing Code Quality and Build Settings](https://github.com/OWASP/owasp-mstg/blob/master/Document/0x06i-Testing-Code-Quality-and-Build-Settings.md)
