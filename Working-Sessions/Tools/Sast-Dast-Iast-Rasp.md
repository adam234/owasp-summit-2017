This Working Session will review SAST, DAST, IAST, and RASP tools currently available. The Session will also discuss how an organisation can cherry-pick the best of each tool to give a cost-effective appsec vulnerability management capability that meets their needs.

## Why

There are many tools that can help an organisation to check vulnerabilities in their software. Each tool has a specific place where it will be applied, and will yield many findings to analyse and track.

## What

 - Create cheat sheets for tools usage? (Can this be done in an agnostic way?)
 - How and where to add tools in a CI pipeline effectively?
 - Integration with visualization tools/IDEs?
 - How to parse and filter results? 
 - Draft recommendations for writing specific tests

## Outcomes

- Cheat sheets for tools usage
- Draft recommendations for writing specific tests

## Who

The target audience for this Working Session is:

- AppSec professionals
- *ST* and RASP service providers
