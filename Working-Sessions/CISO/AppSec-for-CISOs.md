It seems AppSec is a growing area for a lot of CISOs - you have secured the outside, you know where the traffic is going. You have a handle on data use and storage. But what are your apps doing?

## Why

The aim of this Working Session is to examine AppSec from the vantage point of the CISO, focusing on the following questions:

- What should you know?
- What is coming down the line?
- What is there already?
- How to shape this, guide this, and ensure there are no nasty surprises?

## What

- What to beware of
- How to build teams and policies
- What frameworks to look out for
- Technologies
- Hints and tips

## Outcomes

## Who

The target audience for this Working Session is:
