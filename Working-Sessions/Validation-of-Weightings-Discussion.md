## Why

This session will focus on creating weightings to produce the 2017, 2020, and 2023 OWASP Top 10s, especially as AI and ML will start to make an impact.

## What

 - Validate the approach set out in Seession 2, given 2013 and 2017 data
 - Consider potential for 2020 data
 - Based on this validation, we may need to re-order, add, or delete findings based on the defined weightings.
