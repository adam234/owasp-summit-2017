## Why


## What

This session is to peer review the existing text that will go forward without major change. I don't think a lot of the more vocal critics have actually read the entire Top 10, so let's apply a strong macro lens on the other items, foreword, and any additional material.

## Outcomes



## Who

The target audience for this Working Session is:

 - OWASP Top 10 2017 Track participants
