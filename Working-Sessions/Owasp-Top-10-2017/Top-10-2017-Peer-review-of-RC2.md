## Why


## What

There will be an RC2 coming out of the summit. I would like folks to come back on Day 5 and review a near to final RC2 that we create together at the Project Summit.
Need 3 or 4 hours for this so we can review all of the revised RC2 document. Please schedule for 11 am - 3 pm BST, and folks can come and go as they please.
