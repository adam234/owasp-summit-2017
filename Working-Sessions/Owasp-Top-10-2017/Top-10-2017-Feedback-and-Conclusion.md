Let's work through any community feedback that has been received and work through *constructive* and *positive* feedback, coming up with a consensus view of a RC2 OWASP Top 10. I want these to be logged as GitHub issues so that we can work through creating an RC2 draft by the end of the week with agreed community feedback implemented.
