## Why

Given the scale of the Ransomware market ($209 million paid in 2016), the scale of its operations (50% of organisations have responded to a Ransomware campaign), and increased use of technology in the form of exploits used to propagate attacks, it is a matter of time before a security team must deal with a Ransomware incident.

When that happens, it is imperative that clean workflows (aka playbooks) exist, so that the team can respond in a consistent, focused, and repeatable way. This Working Session will create a Ransomware Playbook for use by security teams.
