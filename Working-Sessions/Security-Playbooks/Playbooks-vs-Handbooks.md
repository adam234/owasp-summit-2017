A [Playbook](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Playbook) can be
> "A document defining one or more business process workflows aimed at ensuring a consistent response to situations commonly encountered during the operation of the business" (Wikipedia)

## Why

The Cisco security blog describes a Playbook in the following way:

> "... To be clear, the Playbook is for organizing and documenting security monitoring. It isn’t an incident response handbook or a policy document or any other type of security document or handbook. The Playbook may reference things like the Incident Response Handbook or Acceptable Use Policy, but it isn’t a replacement for these...."

(see [Using a “Playbook” Model to Organize Your Information Security Monitoring Strategy](http://blogs.cisco.com/security/using-a-playbook-model-to-organize-your-information-security-monitoring-strategy) )

But should this distinction be made?

Isn't it better to consolidate the actions of the SecOps Team, AppSec Team, and SOC into Playbooks (i.e. workflows on how to act/behave)?

This Working Session will discuss and clarify these issues with the aim of agreeing on a definition of Playbook.
