## Why

This Working Session will create a Media Handling Playbook.

When, not if, a security incident occurs, and whether the incident takes the shape of ransomware, a PII information disclosure, or an OWASP Top 10 exploitation, it is critical to have a clear plan in place for how to handle customers and the media. This is especially true in the context of GDPR notice requirements.

Multiple scenarios with defined trigger points must be agreed and in place.

Customers and regulatory bodies tend to be more understanding when communications about an incident are quick, accurate, and technically correct.
