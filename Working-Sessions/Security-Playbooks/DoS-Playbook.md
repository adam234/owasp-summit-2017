## Why

Denial-of-Service (DoS) attacks are not only becoming more common, they are moving up the stack.

In the past, DoS was very network-based (sending many similar requests), and could be detected and mitigated at the edge of the network. The new generation of DoS generates much less traffic, but is very effective in the way it targets parts of the application that are computationally expensive.

When that happens, it is essential that very clean workflows (aka playbooks) exist, so that the team can respond in a consistent, focused, and repeatable way. Therefore, this Working Session will create a DoS playbook.
