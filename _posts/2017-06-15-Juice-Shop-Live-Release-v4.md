title       : Juice Shop v4.0.0 Live Release
post-date   : Jun 15

The
[Juice Shop track](https://owaspsummit.org/Working-Sessions/Juice-Shop/)
of the OWASP Summit 2017 was not only a very enjoyable experience but
also produced some **_really_ tangible output**!

In the
[final morning session on Friday, June 16th](https://owaspsummit.org/Working-Sessions/Juice-Shop/Juice-Shop-Release.html)
(in room _Pedley_) I will trigger the production release of the v4.0.0
version. It comes with a load of new business functionality, challenges,
convenience feats and technical advancents!

While the (fully automated) release is underway, I am happy to give an
overview of the newly added features and maybe some participants already
want to try them out right on the spot to be the first to conquer them?
