title       : Juice Shop's call to pre-summit action
post-date   : May 27

I am organizing
[the Juice Shop track](https://owaspsummit.org/Working-Sessions/Juice-Shop/)
around
["the most trustworthy online shop out there."](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Juice_Shop_Project)
To get the most out of the summit for the project, I would like to give
you some background on the session agenda and its intended outcome:

I've been assembling all existing ideas and requests for new hacking
challenges under a GitHub milestone named [OWASP Summit Challenge Pack
2017](https://github.com/bkimminich/juice-shop/milestone/3). There are
other interesting things to implement for the Juice Shop project than
just hacking challenges, e.g. [enhancements to the
CTF-extension command line tool](https://github.com/bkimminich/juice-shop-ctf/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Aenhancement)!
üö©

The ultimate goal of the Juice Shop working session is to drive the
implementation of as many challenges & other enhancements as possible
and have them released by the end of the summit on June 16th. üèÅ

As many other interesting and promising working sessions compete for
your attention on the summit schedule, here are some ideas how we can
achieve this goal together:

1. If you didn't already, please sign up as a participant for the
   working session via a GitHub Pull Request to either your participant
   file or
   [the working session files](https://github.com/OWASP/owasp-summit-2017/tree/master/Working-Sessions/Juice-Shop)!
   ‚úç
2. Go through the issues of the
   [OWASP Summit Challenge Pack 2017](https://github.com/bkimminich/juice-shop/milestone/3)
   and comment on them with your design & implementation ideas! üìê
3. Create new issues with your own fresh challenge ideas! Provide as
   much background on the underlying vulnerability/risk you want to see
   represented in the Juice Shop! üí°
4. Make sure you have
   [read the contribution guideline](https://github.com/bkimminich/juice-shop/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)
   before you start any work! üìÉ
5. Fork and clone <https://github.com/bkimminich/juice-shop>, pick any
   issue from GitHub and start coding before the summit begins! üç¥ If
   you need help, just
   [ping me via email](mailto:bjoern.kimminich@owasp.org)!

The tasks 1-4 are somewhat mandatory for working session participants,
because without this kind of preparation it'd be next to impossible to
be productive. Task 5 is nice to have, because we can sure
[do the coding
in the evening(s)](http://owaspsummit.org/Working-Sessions/Security-Crowdsourcing/Hackathon-Daily-Sessions.html),
but the more we get done beforehand, the more time we have to attend
other sessions!

And if you are not a programmer? Please still join the working session
as an attack path engineer üèπ or a challenge beta-tester üêõ or maybe
you want to help as a solution editor üìì by updating the
[Pwning OWASP Juice Shop](https://www.gitbook.com/book/bkimminich/pwning-owasp-juice-shop/details)
companion guide ebook with hints & solutions to the new challenges?

Btw, the Juice Shop working session is exceptionally well-suited for
remote participation, as you can of course implement changes at home
while the on-site participants do the same in the evening session(s)!

Finally, I would like to advertise some related working sessions from
the "Education" track which might be interesting for you as well:
- [Teaching Attacker Perspective to Developers](http://owaspsummit.org/Working-Sessions/Education/Teaching-Attacker-Perspective-to-Developers.html)
- [Evaluation/Optimization/Creation of Training Slides](http://owaspsummit.org/Working-Sessions/Education/Evaluation-Optimization-and-Creation-of-Training-Slides.html)
- The _Hands on Threat Modeling Juice Shop_ session series on the
  [Threat Model Track](https://owaspsummit.org/Working-Sessions/Threat-Model)
- [CTFs](http://owaspsummit.org/Working-Sessions/Education/CTFs.html)
  (still needs someone to take the lead...)
