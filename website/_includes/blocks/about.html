          <p>This is not a conference with uni-directional presentations. Using the same model as the past two OWASP Summits in Portugal, this 5-day event will be a high-energy experience, during which attendees get the chance to work and collaborate intensively. Every thoroughly prepared working session is geared towards a specific application security challenge and will be focused on actionable outcomes.</p>
          <p>If you care about Application Security and want to collaborate with the key players in this industry, this is the event to be.</p>
