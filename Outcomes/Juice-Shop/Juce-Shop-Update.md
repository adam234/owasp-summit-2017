The
[Juice Shop track](https://owaspsummit.org/Working-Sessions/Juice-Shop/)
of the OWASP Summit 2017 was not only a very enjoyable experience but
also produced some **_really_ tangible output**!

In the
[final morning session on Friday, June 16th](https://owaspsummit.org/Working-Sessions/Juice-Shop/Juice-Shop-Release.html)
I triggered the production release of the v4.0.0 version. It comes with
new business functionality, challenges, convenience feats and technical
advances!

While the (fully automated) release is underway, I am happy to give an
overview of the newly-added features and maybe some participants already
want to try and be the first to conquer them? ü•á
