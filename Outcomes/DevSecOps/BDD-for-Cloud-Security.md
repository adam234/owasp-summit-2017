## Outcomes

This Working Session will publish BDD specifications for those requirements (no implementation code, just specs), and will link the specs to CSA, NIST, and other standards.

### Synopsis and Takeaways

- Communication is vital for BDD, so providing a template for BDD and Cloud Security BDD is important 
- References to existing BDD stories and solutions for non-cloud security e.g., BDD-Security
- Provide an overview of the advantages that BDD has for security e.g., Example stories
- Example Story: Scenario - There is at least one non-root admin user in the account - Story - WHEN we enumerate the user accounts THEN there should be at least one non-root admin account.
