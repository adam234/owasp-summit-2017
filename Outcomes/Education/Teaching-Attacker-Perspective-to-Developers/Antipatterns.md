### Outcomes

Good trainers will be aware of and avoid, the antipatterns listed below.

#### ZAP'n'Burp

Try to teach the use of non-trivial tools like OWASP ZAP or BurpSuite
along the way during beginner-level web security training.

#### Time waster

Lecture for too long and try to compensate
by a) skipping or b) cutting the far more interesting exercises and
demos.

#### Toy overkill

Overwhelm students with too many pentesting and hacking tools
during developer training. Worst case: Let them use Kali Linux right
from the start.

#### Elongated code reviews

Going through an extensive code snippet line by line by line by ...
Zzzzzz...

#### Wrong tech stack

Focus too much on vulnerabilities that are not relevant to the
techology stack used by the developers you are training.

#### Mandatory training

Force every developer into generic security training even though it
might not affect them in their daily work.
