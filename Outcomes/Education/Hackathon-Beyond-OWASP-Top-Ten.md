#### General Rules for Participatants

The hackathon will be organised on the [avatao](https://avatao.com) platform, which is a commercial product to teach 
people how to build secure products. In accordance with the general rules of the OWASP Summit 2017, a dedicated learning 
path will be set up for all the on-site and remote conference participants *free of charge*. The organisers of the Hackathon 
will help the participants on-site, but the Hackathon will continue to be available after the conference. 

#### Outcome

 -A very successful hackathon about software security; we also collected ideas for new challenges.
