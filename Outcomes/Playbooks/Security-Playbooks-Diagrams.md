## Outcomes

- Diagrams of Security Playbooks published

### Synopsis and Takeaways

We discussed how best to visualise the information contained in a playbook, realising that without data, we are restricted to process flows.

OWASP is proactive, but we recognise that certain situations are reactive by nature â€“ you can only start to solve a problem when the problem arises.

We agreed that playbooks should include process diagrams, but only where necessary.  It is difficult to come up with diagrams without data, and data usually comes after the playbook has been followed (e.g., pen-test, bug bounty).

We also agreed that we should create iconography for different audiences to help readers define the scope of the playbook. The audiences could include:

- The buyer or end-user
- The person who follows the process
- The person who takes the result of the process and deals with the outcome (analyse, distil, process).

#### Diagrams

Ayehu's site has a really good example of what these diagrams could look like:

The Phantom product seems to have native Playbook support (which can be also scripted):

Threat Connect also looks interesting:
