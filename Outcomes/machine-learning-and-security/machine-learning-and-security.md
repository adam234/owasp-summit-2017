## Outcomes

### Synopsis and Takeaways 

- Create common datasets with the purpose of testing and validating the security of machine learning algorithms
  - We can use data output of Mod Security, WebGoat and others to create the datasets
  - These datasets should be shared
  - Anonymized dataset
  - Common dataset for testing

- Create guidance page to include ML security definitions, latest reports, and links to the available tools and datasets
  - Find good materials and resources

- Use ML techniques in the current tools provided by OWASP (e.g., use ML to reduce false positives in ZAP scanning output)

- Create a working group to work on tools and guidance of:
  - How to check if a dataset is noise-free (not compromised)
  - Review of algorithms implementations
