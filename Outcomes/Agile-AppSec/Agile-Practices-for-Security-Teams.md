### Outcomes

A draft list of agile security practices

### Synopsis and Takeaways

The following categories highlight some of the key activities of an agile security team:

#### Education

- Define and deliver security training programmes

#### Communication

- Security team to be visible, present at standups, available
- Connect dev to production
- Empower security champions

#### Standardisation and Compliance

- Own strong guidelines, e.g., data classification, regulatory, compliance
- Two tier security standards? Mandatory, depend on risk/sensitivity, etc.
- Library of standard stories

#### Support

- Technical support
- Help create security user stories, personas, anti-personas, patterns
- Culture of "security is not to say no, but to help"
- Testing
- Automation is needed for CI/CD e.g. tool to track third party licenses
- "Development enablement tribe"

#### Governance/Control

- Project initiation touch point to define "gates"
- Prioritisation of involvement based on risk assessment, lifecycle stage
- Define "done"
- Third party maturity assessment 
- Internal compliance checks
- Centralised tracking in primary colours
- Security team KPIs
- Security organisation must be separate from development
- Monetary value on risks helps prioritisation
- Risk acceptance/escalation process

#### Engineering

- Bring in shared security solutions such as WAF- engineering effort

#### Practices

- Perhaps agile not applicable, more lean/kanban
- View security as functions, not people - resourcing can change but functions don't
- Don't be a blocker to agile, e.g., in operational approvals
- "Security team as a service"
- Struggle to manage BAU and hence forecasting: separate functions
- Need visibility of project portfolio
- Separation of duty can be a constraint
