### Outcomes

### Synopsis and Takeaways

1.	Architecture – Considerations for architecture are to be applied as a workshop via the juice box threat modelling hands-on session. 
The goal is to deconstruct juice box in order to emulate proper threat modelling activities & techniques.
2.	Tools – when a model is created there must be a change log handled automatically by a tool and put on GitHub. DFDs within tools are 
ENS (Microsoft tool) and Vector magic (cedar cake ventures). 
3.	DFD – Common formatting of how the images should be formed. UML will be used. 
4.	Cheat sheets - write and update existing cheat sheets. Create a new sheet in do's and don’ts in threat modelling. 
5.	LTWT - Agile, business analytics, STRIDE, information disclosure, DDOS and escalation of privilege were discussed. 
6.	Templates/demonstrations – we agreed that all templates will be modular so they can be chained together. 

The aims are to provide templates for

- Internet of things/microcomputers such as pies
  o	Consumer electronics (cars) 
  o	IDS (industry control systems) such as medical transportation and utilities 
-	Mobile 
  o	Mobile clients
  o	Find vulnerabilities in Apple and android systems
  o	Correlate all the mobile information to the OWASP mobile top 10
-	WEB API
  o	XML-RPC
  o	WSDL
  o	SOAP
  o	REST
-	Websites/CMS 
  o	View from a generic technology agnostic will be taken
  o	Use cases with a control flow
-	Fire upload
-	Authentication
-	Transport security 
-	Authorization/ RBAC 
-	Administrative use case
  o	Abuse Cases
-	Privilege escalation
-	RCE 
-	Authentication bypass
-	DOS 
-	Client server
7.	 Internet of things – Interaction with multiple templates so a suitable model can be chosen. Specific technologies that were proposed to research further
-	BLE 
-	GAAT
-	HTTP
-	TCP
-	MQTT (transport technology)

#### Outcomes
-	A guide to be created on prioritisation, 
  o	Architecture
  o	Risk centric, Data centric CIA, GDPR and PCI compliance 
-	Substantiate threat model libraries with threat research that can correlate to application threat models
-	Correlate content from OWASP deliverables in order to standardize Countermeasure Library. (e.g. – Mobile)
-	Develop threat modelling templates based upon deployment model/ implementation type
-	Develop threat library - Research evidence for a new threats library:
  o	FBI
  o	DFIR
  o	PWC
  o	INTERPOL
  o	* - ISAC
  o	CERTS
