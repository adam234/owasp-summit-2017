I would like to lead a workshop around [The OWASP Internet of Things Project](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Internet_of_Things_Project), and [The OWASP Game Security Framework](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Game_Security_Framework_Project).

## The IoT Security Project

The IoT Security project is a collection of sub-projects aimed at helping developers, testers, manufacturers, and anyone else interested in IoT to better understand the risks inherent in IoT systems and how to mitigate them.

A few of the key (sub)projects are the IoT Attack Surfaces, which describe all  the various ways that IoT systems can be probed and attacked, the IoT Vulnerabilities Project, which highlights the top vulnerabilities in IoT systems, and the ICS/SCADA Vulnerabilities project, which lists the top vulnerabilities in those systems.

There are many other sub-projects as well, both existing and needed, that we're looking for leaders to adopt and advance.

## The Game Security Framework

The Game Security Framework is a project that aims to raise awareness and knowledge around vulnerabilities in gaming---with specific focus around the types of games used by millions of people globally and that have become a multi-billion-dollar industry.

The framework semantically breaks gaming attacks into sentences that can be easily parsed and understood by anyone, from gamers to testers to game executives. The goal is to help those creating games make better decisions during development, powered by understanding the mistakes of the past, so that  they don't ship a game that people abandon quickly due to hacks.

## Funding

I will be paying my own way to the conference and would like to be reimbursed by OWASP if at all possible.

## Notes

I'm also happy to participate in any other sessions that other leaders would like input on while at the summit. Ping me at daniel.miessler@owasp.org to arrange.
