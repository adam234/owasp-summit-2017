I'm the author of "Threat Modeling: Designing for Security," with 2 decades of experience in secure development work at companies of all sizes.  I'd like to help improve OWASP's threat modeling content by simplifying it, organizing it, and bringing it up to date.

I based cost estimates on flight cost (searched today at http://matrix.itasoftware.com/#view-flights:research=MSPLON-LONSEA; I have other travel that requires this be an open-jaw trip) and on USG costs for London https://aoprals.state.gov/web920/per_diem_post_action.asp?PostName=london
