Yan Kravchenko, CISSP, CSSLP, CISA, CISM has 20 years of experience in the IT / Information Security industry.  Over the past 3 years Yan has been developing ways to leverage OWASP SAMM to help measure application metrics portfolios for maturiy and security weaknesses.  A part of the process is the concept of risk correlation that allows alighing applications against multiple risk measures, creating more realistic and useful metrics data.  

Summit Goals:
* To align my own work / research with OWASP SAMM 2.0
* Share tools / documents / visualizations in hopes of making OWASP SAMM 2.0 more enterprise friendly
* Create a project team to help develop / improve tools for collecting and analyzing data
* Discuss strategies for creating a "public" repository of maturity information that could be shared across different industries

### OWASP Involvement

* PCI Mapping
* Enterprise Metrics Development
