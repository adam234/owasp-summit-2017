Ross currently runs the Information Security & Risk team at La Fosse Associates - the IT, Digital & Business Change recruitment firm. Having placed a number of OWASP members previously, Ross understands the value of building relationships within this community. Given the continuing rise for technically minded Information Security professionals, from the CISO level through to more junior/hands positions, Ross is keen to share feedback on how to position yourself best in the market, what to look for, and what to avoid.
