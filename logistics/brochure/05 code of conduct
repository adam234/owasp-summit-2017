OWASP FOUNDATION
The Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP) is a 501(c)(3) worldwide not-for-profit charitable organization focused on improving the security of software. Our mission is to make software security visible, so that individuals and organizations are able to make informed decisions.

Operating as a community of like-minded professionals, OWASP issues software tools and knowledge-based documentation on application security.
