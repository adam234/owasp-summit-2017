hi,

Welcome to OWASP Summit 2017! The third edition since 2009 and 2011.

This OWASP Summit is a participant driven event, dedicated to the collaboration of Development and Security professionals, with a strong focus on DevSecOps.

Join us in interactive working sessions to tackle some of the hardest security problems we are facing in 2017 and create actionable solutions.

Being able to contribute and get us to contribute on an issue that is your actual challenge, in your organisation, right this moment that would then get re-assessed and re-used by lot of others, represents the foundation of building a safer and more scalable tomorrow.

We invite you to re-shape the way we solve problems within the security space!

Dinis, Francois, Seba
